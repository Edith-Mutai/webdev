      <h1>Dropped Signal</h1>
      <h2>Diary of a Crashout... </h2><br><br>
      <p>The phone left my hand mid-movement. One second it was there, loyal and glowing, the next it was gone, swallowed by speed, asphalt, and bad timing. I was on a bike. Of course I was. There was no dramatic slow motion, no heroic dive to save it. Just a soft, final clack and the sudden understanding that my day had split into a before and an after.<br><br>

Life didn’t stop.
It stalled. Loudly.<br><br>

The world immediately felt suspicious. I couldn’t check the time. I couldn’t text. I couldn’t reassure myself with meaningless scrolling. I was present against my will, raw-dogging reality. Somewhere between panic and disbelief, I decided to continue with my original plan, which was, in hindsight, was the first of many questionable decisions.<br><br>

I was on my way to see someone I was not supposed to be seeing. A situationship, which is just a relationship that doesn’t want witnesses or responsibility. I told myself I was only going to pick up my glasses. Vision. Clarity. Self-respect. You know how the lies start small.<br><br>

When I got there, the door opened into chaos immediately.<br><br>

Friends.
People.
Morning light exposing everything.<br><br>

Four men. One woman. All of them clearly survivors of the previous night. Bottles around. Laughter too loud for the hour. And then me, phone-less, shaken, emotionally buzzing and standing there like a misplaced plot twist.<br><br>

They looked at me and knew.<br><br>

The looks said: Oh. This is the girlfriend.<br><br>

I clocked it instantly. He clocked it too. Nobody corrected it. Interesting.<br><br>

They shuffled out shortly after, announcing they were going to get liquor, because of course they were! leaving me alone with him and the silence that rushes in after people exit a room.<br><br>

He went back to sleep.<br><br>

I lay there stiffly beside him, wanting nothing more than to be held and unconscious. Instead, my nervous system was performing Olympic-level gymnastics. Everything felt urgent. Everything felt loud. I tried to explain, the phone, the panic, the way the day had already gone off the rails.<br><br>

He nodded. Calm. Too calm.<br>

He told me to chill.
Offered me his extra phone,which he didn’t have by the way!!
Like that solved the existential rupture.<br><br>

I considered violence. Briefly. Spiritually.<br><br>

Then hunger entered the chat.<br><br>

I wanted noodles from the shop. Simple. Survival. He said no, casually, like a man who has never experienced emotional collapse enhanced by low blood sugar. That was my breaking point.<br><br>

I left.<br><br>

Bought noodles. Bought cigarettes, which I do not smoke. Let the record show this was a character experiment, not a lifestyle choice. When I came back, the gate was locked. No phone. No key. No dignity.<br><br>

I knocked.
And knocked.
And knocked.<br><br>

I stood there for minutes like a cautionary tale, hoping the earth would open up and take me quietly. Eventually the gate opened. The embarrassment entered first; I followed.<br><br>

Inside, I cooked my noodles like a woman rebuilding civilization from scratch. Ate. Smoked badly. Tried again to cuddle. Tried again to calm my nervous system into submission.<br><br>

Time passed weirdly.

At some point, his friends came back, liquor acquired, energy renewed. Suddenly it was almost 1. We were all in the gazebo now, glasses clinking, music playing, reality pretending this was normal.<br><br>

I said I needed to leave.
He laughed.
I repeated myself.
He stalled.<br><br>

I hate insisting. I hate negotiating for urgency like it’s a favor. Eventually, we took shots because that’s what people do instead of dealing with anything. Eventually, I snapped us out of it and we left, late, of course, because time only matters to the person who feels consequences.

By the time I finally peeled myself away from that house, I felt hollowed out. Drained. Like I’d lived several micro-lives before noon.<br><br>

And then, because the universe loves a theme, I spent the second half of the day with my narcissistic mother. Still tense from the argument the night before. Old wounds reopened casually over conversation. Emotional labor disguised as family time.<br><br>

If the morning was chaos, the afternoon was emotional archaeology.<br><br>

By nightfall, all I knew was this:
I lose my footing when I lose my sense of control.
Men who say “relax” have never been in crisis.
Hunger is dangerous.
And I keep surviving days that feel designed to test my patience specifically.
</p>
<blockquote>This wasn’t a bad day.<br>
It was a revealing one.</blockquote>
<p>So if you want to know me, know this:<br>
I move through the world expecting urgency, honesty, and basic coordination.<br>
And when those fail, I cope with dark humor, stubborn endurance,
and the quiet certainty that tomorrow will ask something else of me.<br><br>

Hopefully with my phone intact.</p>
